This is the start of and idea to make communicate in a user friendly way to an mqtt broker via http. The overall concept
is to be an interface to the broker, and automatically generate html which is decided by the mqtt nodes and streamline
the whole process of IoT control, but open source and more importantly, an hobby project designed to make me learn how
to develop a wide variety of principals, including but not limited to:
    -mqtt
    -http
    -javascript
    -node js
    -python
    -physical computing
    -database design
    -rest principals
Front End Milestones:

    0. Hello browser
    1. dummy buttons - no js
    2. add jquery - no ajax

Back End Milestones:
    (currently ota, and pubsub system are working, the current gui is using pushbullet, which is clunky, and slow and
    provides limited feedback as to current state of switches)
    0. first endpoint, hello lightbulb
    1. open port 80 with authentication.
    2. design the auto generation of html when a new device is detected
    3. get away from node-red!!! rewrite endpoints...
